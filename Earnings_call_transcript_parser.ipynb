       "12   First quarter revenue of $1.03 billion decreased 17% sequentially, primarily due to reduced client and graphics product sales and a seasonal decrease in semicustom system-on-chip sales. In our computing and graphics segment, revenue decreased 20% sequentially in what was a challenging market environment compounded by currency issues. We saw OEM demand in the quarter below seasonal expectations as our customers actively managed inventory levels amid uncertain end-user demand. We also reduced downstream channel inventory levels and remain on track to return to normal inventory levels by the end of the second quarter. As a result of soft PC demand and our work to rebalance our channel demand inventory, desktop processor and GPU revenue decreased significantly from the year-ago period.   \n",
       "13   On the positive side, we did see progress in several of our strategic initiatives. Mobile APU ASPs and revenue increased from the year-ago period, highlighted by increases in commercial client APU shipments and revenue from the fourth quarter, setting a record for commercial client processor sales.

We also successfully passed several key milestones in the quarter as we prepared for the introduction of our new 2015 APU and GPU products, including first revenue shipments of our next-generation Carrizo family of notebook APUs in advance of system launches planned for the second quarter. Carrizo is a standout product that delivers better graphics performance than competitive offerings, as well as all-day battery life, driven by the largest generational performance per watt improvement we have ever delivered with our mainstream APUs.                                                                     \n",

So we continue to believe that we can differentiate in these areas as we accelerate some of our product investments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "193  Yeah. I think, Stacy, the way you want to look at it is the first half of 2019, we do have incremental R&D and go-to-market activities in the first quarter and even in the second. As you know, we are preparing for a strong series of significant 7-nanometer product launches this year and also share gains as we get in the back half of the year. And that's obviously driving the OpEx.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "194  Overall, for the year, we are comfortable in the 29% for the year of overall revenue from an OpEx standpoint. And as you have seen us in the past, we do have a way of modulating the OpEx that need it. But right now, we are investing in the roadmaps, we're investing product launches and the go-to-market activities and very focused to make sure that we are well-positioned in the first half going to the second half where we see the revenue lift compared to the first half of year 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
